## Hash Tables in C
A hash table in C, also known as a **hash map** is a data structure that maps keys to values. A hash table uses a `hash function` to compute indices for a key.

A hash table implements an associative array for the data structure

It uses  a `hash function` to compute an index, or a `hash code`, into an array of slots/positions

Based on the hash table index, the value can be stored at the appropriate location
