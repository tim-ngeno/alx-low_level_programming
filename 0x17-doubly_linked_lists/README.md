## Doubly Linked Lists In C

Doubly linked lists are a special type of linked list, with the node containing two pointers: one to the next node, and the other to the previous node.<br>
Doubly linked lists can thus be traversed in forward and backward directions.<br>
Creating a node in a doubly linked list consists of a self-referential struct with a data value, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node.<br>
