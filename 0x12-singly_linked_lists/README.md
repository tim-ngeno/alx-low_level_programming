Singly Linked Lists in C
also called simple linked lists. A singly linked list is a data structure that is made up of nodes. A node is a two-part element consisting of data(the actual value), and a reference  to the next node in the sequence(which is a pointer).
Singly linked lists are not stored sequentially in memory and are only linked using pointers
Singly linked lists, unlike other linked lists, can only be traversed forwards
